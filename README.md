# Node - Configuration Patterns

This repository contains a set of Node.js configuration patterns. They vary from very simple ones to something more sophisticated.

Generally it's a good idea not to put actual configuration to the repository for security reasons. That is why I recommend setting up files which you then copy (ie. `example.config.json`) and modify to suit your needs.
